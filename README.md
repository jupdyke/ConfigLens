configlens.py helps in comparing checkpoint and palo alto networks config files.

It has to be invovked with chkp and pan cfg files as command line arguments.
It then checks for the validity of these two files and shows a menu. The menu
contains options to compare & show the various sections of the cfg files for example
NAT/SEC in both chkp and pan cfg files.
